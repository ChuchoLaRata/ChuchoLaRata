# Hola/Hi I'm @ChuchoLaRata

Currently, I'm learning about software engineering, ML for energy management and lately I'm trying to migrate to Linux.

My nickname stands by the main beneficiary of my income: "Chucho" my lovely and sleepy cat. 

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on energy management projects.
